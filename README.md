# Code performance improvements in Golang

## Code optimization

### Inlining
Inlining is the process of replacing a function call with the function’s body, which can improve performance 
by reducing function call overhead. Escape analysis is the process of determining whether a variable’s 
address is taken, which can help the compiler allocate it on the stack instead of the heap.

### Escape Analysis

```go
func main() {
	var a int
	b := &a
	fnt.Println(b)
}
```

In this example, the a variable is allocated on the stack, since its address is not taken. 
However, the b variable is allocated on the heap, since its address is taken with the & operator.

stack <-- Value
heap <-- Reference

* Note: **Escape analysis is important because heap allocations are more expensive than stack allocations, so minimizing heap allocations can improve performance.**

### Dead Code Elimination
The code that not will be executed must be removed, or it could be removed from the Go compiler.

## Understanding the Execution Tracer:

The execution tracer in Go provides detailed information about what’s happening in a program, including stack traces, goroutine blocking, and more.

### Memory Management and GC Tuning:
In Go, garbage collection is automatic and managed by the runtime. However, there are some ways to tune the garbage collector to improve performance.
